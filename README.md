# c-projects
A collection of projects completed during the first semester of my MSc Comp Sci conversion course.

They vary between some of the first projects ever coded up and my final ones during the Programming in C module. Each project corresponds to an exercise in [exercisesInC.pdf](exercisesInC.pdf). Please have a read through the exercise detail before having a look at the code.
